# IdleKey3
 Simple utility to turn off RGB lights on Corsair devices when your computer is idle

## Description
 Once the set idle time has elapsed, exclusive control is taken of all CUE devices and no lighting is set. This causes all lights to turn off.
 When the computer is active again, exclusive control is released which restores the previous lighting.
